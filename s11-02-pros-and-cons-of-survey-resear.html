        <h2 class="title editable block">Strengths of Survey Method</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p01">Researchers employing survey methods to collect data enjoy a number of benefits. First, surveys are an excellent way to gather lots of information from many people. In my own study of older people’s experiences in the workplace, I was able to mail a written questionnaire to around 500 people who lived throughout the state of Maine at a cost of just over $1,000. This cost included printing copies of my seven-page survey, printing a cover letter, addressing and stuffing envelopes, mailing the survey, and buying return postage for the survey. I realize that $1,000 is nothing to sneeze at. But just imagine what it might have cost to visit each of those people individually to interview them in person. Consider the cost of gas to drive around the state, other travel costs, such as meals and lodging while on the road, and the cost of time to drive to and talk with each person individually. We could double, triple, or even quadruple our costs pretty quickly by opting for an in-person method of data collection over a mailed survey. Thus surveys are relatively <em class="emphasis">cost effective</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Related to the benefit of cost effectiveness is a survey’s potential for <em class="emphasis">generalizability</em>. Because surveys allow researchers to collect data from very large samples for a relatively low cost, survey methods lend themselves to probability sampling techniques, which we discussed in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch07#blackstone_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Sampling"</a>. Of all the data-collection methods described in this text, survey research is probably the best method to use when one hopes to gain a representative picture of the attitudes and characteristics of a large group.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p03">Survey research also tends to be a <em class="emphasis">reliable</em> method of inquiry. This is because surveys are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standardized</a><span class="glossdef">The same questions, phrased in the same way, are posed to all participants, consistent.</span></span> in that the same questions, phrased in exactly the same way, are posed to participants. Other methods, such as qualitative interviewing, which we’ll learn about in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch09#blackstone_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Interviews: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches"</a>, do not offer the same consistency that a quantitative survey offers. This is not to say that all surveys are always reliable. A poorly phrased question can cause respondents to interpret its meaning differently, which can reduce that question’s reliability. Assuming well-constructed question and questionnaire design, one strength of survey methodology is its potential to produce reliable results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">versatility</a><span class="glossdef">A feature of survey research meaning that many different people use surveys for a variety of purposes and in a variety of settings.</span></span> of survey research is also an asset. Surveys are used by all kinds of people in all kinds of professions. I repeat, surveys are used by all kinds of people in all kinds of professions. Is there a light bulb switching on in your head? I hope so. The versatility offered by survey research means that understanding how to construct and administer surveys is a useful skill to have for all kinds of jobs. Lawyers might use surveys in their efforts to select juries, social service and other organizations (e.g., churches, clubs, fundraising groups, activist groups) use them to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts, businesses use them to learn how to market their products, governments use them to understand community opinions and needs, and politicians and media outlets use surveys to understand their constituencies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s01_p05">In sum, the following are benefits of survey research:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Weaknesses of Survey Method</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p01">As with all methods of data collection, survey research also comes with a few drawbacks. First, while one might argue that surveys are flexible in the sense that we can ask any number of questions on any number of topics in them, the fact that the survey researcher is generally stuck with a single instrument for collecting data (the questionnaire), surveys are in many ways rather <em class="emphasis">inflexible</em>. Let’s say you mail a survey out to 1,000 people and then discover, as responses start coming in, that your phrasing on a particular question seems to be confusing a number of respondents. At this stage, it’s too late for a do-over or to change the question for the respondents who haven’t yet returned their surveys. When conducting in-depth interviews, on the other hand, a researcher can provide respondents further explanation if they’re confused by a question and can tweak their questions as they learn more about how respondents seem to understand them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Validity</em> can also be a problem with surveys. Survey questions are standardized; thus it can be difficult to ask anything other than very general questions that a broad range of people will understand. Because of this, survey results may not be as valid as results obtained using methods of data collection that allow a researcher to more comprehensively examine whatever topic is being studied. Let’s say, for example, that you want to learn something about voters’ willingness to elect an African American president, as in our opening example in this chapter. General Social Survey respondents were asked, “If your party nominated an African American for president, would you vote for him if he were qualified for the job?” Respondents were then asked to respond either yes or no to the question. But what if someone’s opinion was more complex than could be answered with a simple yes or no? What if, for example, a person was willing to vote for an African American woman but not an African American man?<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn08_002">I am not at all suggesting that such a perspective makes any sense, but it is conceivable that an individual might hold such a perspective.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch08_s02_s02_p03">In sum, potential drawbacks to survey research include the following:</p>
