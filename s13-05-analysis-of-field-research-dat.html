    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_p01">Field notes are data. But moving from having pages of data to presenting findings from a field study in a way that will make sense to others requires that those data be analyzed. Analysis of field research data is the focus in this final section of the chapter.</p>
    <div class="section" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">From Description to Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p01">Writing and analyzing field notes involves moving from description to analysis. In <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s04#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s04">Section 10.4 "Field Notes"</a>, we considered field notes that are mostly descriptive in nature. Here we’ll consider analytic field notes. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Analytic field notes</a><span class="glossdef">Notes that include the researcher’s impressions about her or his observations.</span></span> are notes that include the researcher’s impressions about his observations. Analyzing field note data is a process that occurs over time, beginning at the moment a field researcher enters the field and continuing as interactions are happening in the field, as the researcher writes up descriptive notes, and as the researcher considers what those interactions and descriptive notes mean.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p02">Often field notes will develop from a more descriptive state to an analytic state when the field researcher exits a given observation period, messy jotted notes or recordings in hand (or in some cases, literally <em class="emphasis">on</em> hand), and sits at a computer to type up those notes into a more readable format. We’ve already noted that carefully paying attention while <em class="emphasis">in</em> the field is important; so too is what goes on immediately upon exiting the field. Field researchers typically spend several hours typing up field notes after each observation has occurred. This is often where the analysis of field research data begins. Having time outside of the field to reflect upon your thoughts about what you’ve seen and the meaning of those observations is crucial to developing analysis in field research studies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p03">Once the analytic field notes have been written or typed up, the field researcher can begin to look for patterns across the notes by coding the data. This will involve the iterative process of open and focused coding that is outlined in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch09#blackstone_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Interviews: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches"</a>. As mentioned several times in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s04#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s04">Section 10.4 "Field Notes"</a>, it is important to note as much as you possibly can while in the field and as much as you can recall after leaving the field because you never know what might become important. Things that seem decidedly unimportant at the time may later reveal themselves to have some relevance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p04">In my field research experience, I was often surprised by the bits of data that turned out to hold some analytic relevance later on. For example, my field notes included a number of direct quotes and descriptions of informal interactions with participants that I didn’t expect would be important but that I nevertheless jotted down. Several of these quotes eventually made their way into my analysis. For example, Polly, who ran the volunteer office for a breast cancer organization, once remarked to me, “We [in the volunteer office] don’t use disposable cups here. It is always best to have coffee in a <em class="emphasis">real</em> mug. It’s much nicer that way” (Blackstone, 2004, p. 187).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_033">Blackstone, A. (2004). Sociability, work, and gender. <em class="emphasis">Equal Opportunities International, 23,</em> 29–44.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p05">It didn’t occur to me at the time that this was just one of many tasks that Polly and other women volunteers do that remains largely invisible to the beneficiaries of their work. Because it is “much nicer” for volunteers to drink out of a real mug instead of a disposable cup, Polly actually spends a large amount of time washing mugs every day, and throughout the day, so that a clean, <em class="emphasis">real</em> mug is always available to the many volunteers who show up for brief volunteer shifts at the office each day. Had I not made a note of the coffee cup interaction with Polly, which at the time seemed rather mundane, I may have missed an important analytic point about the invisibility of some components of women’s volunteer labor that I was later able to make in presentations and publications of the work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p06">Sometimes the analytic process of field researchers and others who conduct inductive analysis is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grounded theory</a><span class="glossdef">A systematic process in which a researcher generates new theory by inductively analyzing her or his qualitative empirical observations.</span></span> (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_034">Glaser, B. G., &amp; Strauss, A. L. (1967). <em class="emphasis">The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research</em>. Chicago, IL: Aldine; Charmaz, K. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis</em>. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> Grounded theory occurs, as you might imagine, from the “ground up.” It requires that one begin with an open-ended and open-minded desire to understand a social situation or setting and involves a systematic process whereby the researcher lets the data guide her rather than guiding the data by preset hypotheses. The goal when employing a grounded theory approach is, perhaps not surprisingly, to generate theory. Its name not only implies that discoveries are made from the ground up but also that theoretical developments are grounded in a researcher’s empirical observations and a group’s tangible experiences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p07">As exciting as it might sound to generate theory from the ground up, the experience can also be quite intimidating and anxiety-producing as the open nature of the process can sometimes feel a little out of control. Without hypotheses to guide their analysis, researchers engaged in grounded theory work may experience some feelings of frustration or angst. The good news is that the process of developing a coherent theory that is grounded in empirical observations can be quite rewarding—not only to researchers but also to their peers who can contribute to the further development of new theories through additional research and to research participants who may appreciate getting a bird’s-eye view of their everyday experiences.</p>
