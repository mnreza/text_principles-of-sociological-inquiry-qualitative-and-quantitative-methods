    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p01">There’s a <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em> cartoon that pretty accurately portrays life for a field researcher (Cotham, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_002">Cotham, F. (2003, September 1). Two barbarians and a professor of barbarian studies. <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/2003/two-barbarians-and-a-professor-of-barbarian-studies/invt/126562">http://www.cartoonbank.com/2003/two-barbarians-and-a-professor-of-barbarian-studies/invt/126562</a></span> It depicts “Two Barbarians and a Professor of Barbarian Studies.” As field researchers, just as in the cartoon, we immerse ourselves in the settings that we study. While the extent to which we immerse ourselves varies (note in the cartoon the professor is riding a horse but has chosen to retain his professorial jacket and pipe), what all field researchers have in common is their participation in “the field.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Field research</a><span class="glossdef">A qualitative method of data collection that involves observing, interacting with, and interviewing people in their natural settings.</span></span> is a qualitative method of data collection aimed at understanding, observing, and interacting with people in their natural settings. Thus when social scientists talk about being in “the field,” they’re talking about being out in the real world and involved in the everyday lives of the people they are studying. Sometimes researchers use the terms <em class="emphasis">ethnography</em> or <em class="emphasis">participant observation</em> to refer to this method of data collection; the former is most commonly used in anthropology, while the latter is used commonly in sociology. In this text, we’ll use two main terms: <em class="emphasis">field research</em> and <em class="emphasis">participant observation</em>. You might think of field research as an umbrella term that includes the myriad activities that field researchers engage in when they collect data: they participate, they observe, they usually interview some of the people they observe, and they typically analyze documents or artifacts created by the people they observe.</p>

        <p class="para">Field research typically involves a combination of participant observation, interviewing, and document or artifact analysis. This chapter focuses primarily on participant observation.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p03">Because we cover interviews and document/artifact analysis in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch09#blackstone_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Interviews: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches"</a> and <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch11#blackstone_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Unobtrusive Research: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches"</a>, here we’ll focus only on the participation and observation aspects of field research. These aspects of field research are usually referenced together and are known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">participant observation</a><span class="glossdef">The parts of field research that involve spending time with and watching one’s research participants; interviewing and document/artifact analysis are the other two components of field research.</span></span>. Like field research, participant observation also has multiple meanings. Researchers conducting participant observation vary in the extent to which they participate or observe (Junker, 1960).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_003">Junker, B. H. (1960). <em class="emphasis">Field work: An introduction to the social sciences</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> You might say that there’s a continuum of participant observation, where complete observation lies at end of the continuum and complete participation lies at the other end.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p04">In other chapters, we discuss two works that could fall on either end of the participant observation continuum. Barrie Thorne’s (1993)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_004">Thorne, B. (1993). <em class="emphasis">Gender play: Girls and boys in school</em>. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.</span> observations of children in classrooms, school cafeterias, hallways, and playgrounds rest near the complete observation end of the continuum. Rather than actually pretending to be an elementary school student and interacting with her research participants as they would each other, Thorne observed (which, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch04#blackstone_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Beginning a Research Project"</a>, was probably a wise move since it would have been difficult to convince the students that she was one of them). Laud Humphreys’s (1970)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_005">Humphreys, L. (1970). <em class="emphasis">Tearoom trade: Impersonal sex in public places</em>. London, UK: Duckworth.</span> research on the tearoom trade, described in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch03#blackstone_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Research Ethics"</a>, could be said to rest on the other end of the continuum. Rather than <em class="emphasis">only</em> observe, Humphreys played the key tearoom role of watch queen, a role that nonresearcher participants in the trade also played. Humphreys also did not tell many of the people he observed that he was a researcher; thus from the perspectives of many of his “subjects,” he was <em class="emphasis">only</em> a participant. The participant observation continuum is represented in <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_f02">Figure 10.3</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p05">There are pros and cons associated with both aspects of the participant observer’s role. Complete observers may miss important aspects of group interaction and don’t have the opportunity to <em class="emphasis">fully</em> grasp what life is like for the people they observe. At the same time, sitting back and observing may grant them opportunities to see interactions that they would miss were they more involved. Complete participation has the benefit of allowing researchers a real taste of life in the group that they study. Some argue that participation is the only way to understand what it is that we investigate. On the other hand, complete participants may find themselves in situations that they’d rather not face but cannot excuse themselves from <em class="emphasis">because</em> they’ve adopted the role of complete participant. Also, complete participants who do not reveal themselves as researchers must face the ethical quandary of possibly deceiving their “subjects.” In reality, most field research projects lie somewhere near the middle of the observer-participant continuum. Field researchers typically participate to at least some extent in their field sites, but there are also times when they may just observe. Where would <em class="emphasis">you</em> feel most comfortable as a field researcher—as an observer, a participant, or a bit of both?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p06">As you might have imagined based on the examples of Thorne’s and Humphreys’s work, field research is well equipped to answer “how” kinds of questions. Whereas survey researchers often aim to answer “why” questions, field researchers ask <em class="emphasis">how</em> the processes they study occur, <em class="emphasis">how</em> the people they spend time with in the field interact, and <em class="emphasis">how</em> events unfold. <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_t01">Table 10.1 "Field Research Examples"</a> presents just a few examples of the kinds of questions field researchers have asked in past projects along with a brief summary of where and what role those researchers took in the field. The examples presented in <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_t01">Table 10.1 "Field Research Examples"</a> by no means represent an exhaustive list of the variations of questions field researchers have asked or of the range of field research projects that have been conducted over the years, but they do provide a snapshot of the kinds of work sociological field researchers engage in.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s01_p07">Field research is a method that was originally crafted by anthropologists for the purpose of cultural understanding and interpretation (Wolcott, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_013">Wolcott, H. F. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Ethnography: A way of seeing</em> (2nd ed.). Lanham, MD: Altamira Press.</span> Dissatisfied with studying groups of people based solely on secondhand accounts and inspection of artifacts, several anthropologists decided to try living in or near the communities they studied to learn from and about them. Two anthropologists in particular, Franz Boas (1888)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_014">Boas, F. (1888). <em class="emphasis">The central Eskimo</em>. Washington, DC: Bureau of American Ethnology.</span> and Bronislaw Malinowski (1922),<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_015">Malinowski, B. (1922). <em class="emphasis">Argonauts of the western Pacific: An account of native enterprise and adventure in the archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea</em>. London, UK: G. Routledge &amp; Sons; New York, NY: E. P. Dutton.</span> are credited with developing this method around the turn of the 20th century. Boas lived with native populations in Canada and in the American Northwest. Malinowski lived in Papua New Guinea with people who were native to the area. Sociologists picked up on the idea and on the benefits of field research (which we’ll examine in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch10_s02#blackstone_1.0-ch10_s02">Section 10.2 "Pros and Cons of Field Research"</a>). Soon a number of sociologists had embraced this new method and adapted field research for their own studies of groups. Many of the early field researchers in sociology were former social workers who got interested in sociological research because of experiences in their roles as social reformers. The University of Chicago in particular played a key role in the development of American field research through, among other projects, its involvement in Hull House,<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn10_016">Jane Addams Hull House Association.
