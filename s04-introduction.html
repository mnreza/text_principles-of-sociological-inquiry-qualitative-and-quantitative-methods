        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s00_p01">Do you like to know things? Do you ever wonder what other people know or how they know what they do? Have you ever made a decision, and do you plan to make decisions in the future? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you will probably find the information in this book—particularly the information on research methods—very useful. If you answered no to all of them, I suspect that you will have reconsidered by the time you finish reading this text. Let’s begin by focusing on the information in this chapter. Here we’ll consider the variety of ways that we know things and what makes social scientific knowledge unique. We’ll also consider why any of this might matter to you and preview what’s to come in later chapters.</p>

But <em class="emphasis">how</em> do you know that I’m wrong? And why did people once believe that they <em class="emphasis">knew</em> that the world was flat? Presumably the shape of the earth did not change dramatically in the time that we went from “knowing” one thing about it to knowing the other; however, something certainly changed our minds. Understanding both what changed our minds (science) and how might tell us a lot about what we know, what we think we know, and what we think we can know.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">This book is dedicated to understanding exactly how it is that we know what we know. More specifically, we will examine the ways that sociologists come to know social facts. Our focus will be on one particular way of knowing: social scientific <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research methods</a><span class="glossdef">A systematic process of inquiry applied to learn something about our social world.</span></span>. Research methods are a systematic process of inquiry applied to learn something about our social world. But before we take a closer look at research methods, let’s consider some of our other sources of knowledge.</p>
    <div class="section" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Different Sources of Knowledge</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">What do you know about only children? Culturally, our stereotype of children without siblings is that they grow up to be rather spoiled and unpleasant. We might think that the social skills of only children will not be as well developed as those of people who were reared with siblings. However, sociological research shows that children who grow up without siblings are no worse off than their counterparts with siblings when it comes to developing good social skills (Bobbitt-Zeher &amp; Downey, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_001">Bobbitt-Zeher, D., &amp; Downey, D. B. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Good for nothing? Number of siblings and friendship nominations among adolescents.</em> Presented at the 2010 Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association, Atlanta, GA.</span> Sociologists consider precisely these types of assumptions that we take for granted when applying research methods in their investigations. Sometimes we find that our assumptions are correct. Often as in this case, we learn that the thing that everyone seems to know to be true isn’t so true after all.<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_002">The findings from the Bobbit-Zeher and Downey study were featured in a number of news articles in 2010. For one such example, see the following article: Mozes, A. (2010). Being an only child won’t harm social skills. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/parenting-family/2010-08-19-only-child_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/parenting-family/2010-08-19-only-child_N.htm</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Many people seem to know things without having a background in sociology. Of course, they may have been trained in other social science disciplines or in the natural sciences, or perhaps they read about findings from scientific research. However, there are ways we know things that don’t involve scientific research methods. Some people know things through experiences they’ve had, but they may not think about those experiences systematically; others believe they know things based on selective observation or overgeneralization; still others may assume that what they’ve always known to be true is true simply <em class="emphasis">because</em> they’ve always known it to be true. Let’s consider some of these alternative ways of knowing before focusing on sociology’s way of knowing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">Many of us know things simply because we’ve experienced them directly. For example, you would know that electric fences can be pretty dangerous and painful if you touched one while standing in a puddle of water. We all probably have times we can recall when we learned something because we experienced it. If you grew up in Minnesota, you would observe plenty of kids learn each winter that it really is true that one’s tongue will stick to metal if it’s very cold outside. Similarly, if you passed a police officer on a two-lane highway while driving 20 miles over the speed limit, you would probably learn that that’s a good way to earn a traffic ticket. So direct experience may get us accurate information but only if we’re lucky (or unlucky, as in the examples provided here). In each of these instances, the observation process isn’t really deliberate or formal. Instead, you would come to know what you believe to be true through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informal observation</a><span class="glossdef">Making observations without any systematic process for observing or assessing accuracy of what is observed.</span></span>. The problem with informal observation is that sometimes it is right, and sometimes it is wrong. And without any systematic process for observing or assessing the accuracy of our observations, we can never <em class="emphasis">really</em> be sure that our informal observations are accurate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">Suppose a friend of yours declared that “all men lie all the time” shortly after she’d learned that her boyfriend had told her a fib. The fact that one man happened to lie to her in one instance came to represent all experiences with all men. But do <em class="emphasis">all</em> men really lie <em class="emphasis">all</em> the time? Probably not. If you prompted your friend to think more broadly about her experiences with men, she would probably acknowledge that she knew many men who, to her knowledge, had never lied to her and that even her boyfriend didn’t generally make a habit of lying. This friend committed what social scientists refer to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">selective observation</a><span class="glossdef">Noticing only patterns that one has experienced directly or wishes to find.</span></span> by noticing only the pattern that she wanted to find at the time. If, on the other hand, your friend’s experience with her boyfriend had been her <em class="emphasis">only</em> experience with any man, then she would have been committing what social scientists refer to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">overgeneralization</a><span class="glossdef">Assuming that broad patterns exist based on very limited observations.</span></span>, assuming that broad patterns exist based on very limited observations.</p>


        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">Another way that people claim to know what they know is by looking to what they’ve always known to be true. There’s an urban legend about a woman who for years used to cut both ends off of a ham before putting it in the oven (Mikkelson &amp; Mikkelson, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_003">Mikkelson, B., &amp; Mikkelson, D. P. (2005). Grandma’s cooking secret. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/weddings/newlywed/secret.asp">http://www.snopes.com/weddings/newlywed/secret.asp</a></span> She baked ham that way because that’s the way her mother did it, so clearly that was the way it was <em class="emphasis">supposed</em> to be done. Her mother was the authority, after all. After years of tossing cuts of perfectly good ham into the trash, however, she learned that the only reason her mother ever cut the ends off ham before cooking it was that she didn’t have a pan large enough to accommodate the ham without trimming it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p06">Without questioning what we think we know to be true, we may wind up believing things that are actually false. This is most likely to occur when an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">authority</a><span class="glossdef">A socially defined source of knowledge.</span></span> tells us that something is so (Adler &amp; Clark, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_004">The definition for authority provided here comes from the following source: Adler, E. S., &amp; Clark, R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">An invitation to social research: How it’s done</em>. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> Our mothers aren’t the only possible authorities we might rely on as sources of knowledge. Other common authorities we might rely on in this way are the government, our schools and teachers, and our churches and ministers. Although it is understandable that someone might believe something to be true because someone he or she looks up to or respects has said it is so, this way of knowing differs from the sociological way of knowing, which is our focus in this text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p07">As a science, sociology relies on a systematic process of inquiry for gaining knowledge. That process, as noted earlier, is called research methods. We’ll discuss that process in more detail later in this chapter and throughout the text. For now, simply keep in mind that it is this source of knowledge on which sociologists rely most heavily.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Ontology and Epistemology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">Thinking about what you know and how you know what you know involves questions of ontology and epistemology. Perhaps you’ve heard these terms before in a philosophy class; however, they are relevant to the work of sociologists as well. As we sociologists begin to think about finding something out about our social world, we are probably starting from some understanding of what “is,” what can be known about what is, and what the best mechanism happens to be for learning about what is.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ontology</a><span class="glossdef">An analytic philosophy concerning the nature of reality.</span></span> deals with the first part of these sorts of questions. It refers to one’s analytic philosophy of the nature of reality. In sociology, a researcher’s ontological position might shape the sorts of research questions he or she asks and how those questions are posed. Some sociologists take the position that reality is in the eye of the beholder and that our job is to understand others’ view of reality. Other sociologists feel that, while people may differ in their perception of reality, there is only one <em class="emphasis">true</em> reality. These sociologists are likely to aim to discover that true reality in their research rather than discovering a variety of realities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p03">Like ontology, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">epistemology</a><span class="glossdef">An analytic philosophy concerning how we know what we know.</span></span> has to do with knowledge. But rather than dealing with questions about what is, epistemology deals with questions of <em class="emphasis">how</em> we know what is. In sociology, there are a number of ways to uncover knowledge. We might interview people to understand public opinion about some topic, or perhaps we’ll observe them in their natural environment. We could avoid face-to-face interaction altogether by mailing people surveys for them to complete on their own or by reading what people have to say about their opinions in newspaper editorials. All these are ways that sociologists gain knowledge. Each method of data collection comes with its own set of epistemological assumptions about how to find things out. We’ll talk in more depth about these ways of knowing in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch08#blackstone_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Survey Research: A Quantitative Technique"</a> through <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch12#blackstone_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Other Methods of Data Collection and Analysis"</a>, our chapters on data collection.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Science of Sociology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">The sources of knowledge we discussed in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01#blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01">Section 1.1 "How Do We Know What We Know?"</a> could have been labeled sources of <em class="emphasis">belief</em>. In sociology, however, our aim is to discover knowledge. Because sociology is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">science</a><span class="glossdef">A way of knowing that attempts to systematically collect and categorize facts or truths.</span></span>, while we may examine beliefs in order to understand what they are and where they come from, ultimately we aim to contribute to and enhance knowledge. Science is a particular way of knowing that attempts to systematically collect and categorize facts or truths. A key word here is <em class="emphasis">systematically</em>; conducting science is a deliberate process. Unlike the ways of knowing described in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01#blackstone_1.0-ch01_s01">Section 1.1 "How Do We Know What We Know?"</a>, scientists gather information about facts in a way that is organized and intentional and usually follows a set of predetermined steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">More specifically, sociology is a <em class="emphasis">social</em> science. In other words, sociology uses organized and intentional procedures to uncover facts or truths about society. As you probably recall from your introductory sociology class, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sociology</a><span class="glossdef">The scientific study of humans in groups.</span></span> is the scientific study of humans in groups. Sociologists study how individuals shape, are shaped by, and create and maintain their social groups. The groups that sociologists study may be as small as individual families or couples or as large as whole nations. The main point, however, is that sociologists study human beings in relation to one another. In <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch02#blackstone_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Linking Methods With Theory"</a>, we’ll explore how variations within sociology such as theoretical perspective may shape a researcher’s approach. For now the important thing to remember is what makes up sociology as a whole. Two key elements are its focus on human social behavior and its scientific approach toward understanding that behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">A <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em> cartoon once portrayed a little boy looking up at his father while the father tells him, “I’m a social scientist, Michael. That means I can’t explain electricity or anything like that, but if you ever want to know about people I’m your man” (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/1986/im-a-social-scientist-michael-that-means-i-cant-explain-electricity-or-anything-like-that-/invt/116658">http://www.cartoonbank.com/1986/im-a-social-scientist-michael-that-means-i-cant-explain-electricity-or-anything-like-that-/invt/116658</a>). As the cartoon implies, sociologists aim to understand people. And while the cartoon may also imply that sociologists don’t have much to contribute that will be of interest to others, hopefully you will be convinced this is not the case by the time you finish this text. But first, let’s move on to a few specific considerations of which all social scientists should be aware.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Specific Considerations for the Social Sciences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">One of the first and most important things to keep in mind about sociology is that sociologists aim to explain <em class="emphasis">patterns</em> in society. Most of the time, a pattern will not explain every single person’s experience, a fact about sociology that is both fascinating and frustrating. It is fascinating because, even though the individuals who create a pattern may not be the same over time and may not even know one another, collectively they create a pattern. Those new to sociology may find these patterns frustrating because they may believe that the patterns that describe their gender, their age, or some other facet of their lives don’t really represent their experience. It’s true. A pattern can exist among your cohort without your individual participation in it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Let’s consider some specific examples. One area that sociologists commonly investigate is the impact of a person’s social class background on his or her experiences and lot in life. You probably wouldn’t be surprised to learn that a person’s social class background has an impact on his or her educational attainment and achievement. In fact, one group of researchers (Ellwood &amp; Kane, 2000) in the early 1990s found that the percentage of children who did not receive any postsecondary schooling was four times greater among those in the lowest quartile income bracket than those in the upper quartile of income earners (i.e., children from high-income families were far more likely than low-income children to go on to college).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_005">Ellwood, D., &amp; Kane, T. (2000). Who gets a college education? Family background and growing gaps in enrollment. In S. Danziger &amp; J. Waldfogel (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Securing the future</em> (pp. 283–324). New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation.</span> Another recent study found that having more liquid wealth that can be easily converted into cash actually seems to predict children’s math and reading achievement (Elliott, Jung, Kim, &amp; Chowa, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_006">Elliott, W., Jung, H., Kim, K., &amp; Chowa, G. (2010). A multi-group structural equation model (SEM) examining asset holding effects on educational attainment by race and gender. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Children &amp; Poverty, 16,</em> 91–121.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">These findings, that wealth and income shape a child’s educational experiences, are probably not that shocking to any of us, even if we know someone who may be an exception to the rule. Sometimes the patterns that social scientists observe fit our commonly held beliefs about the way the world works. When this happens, we don’t tend to take issue with the fact that patterns don’t necessarily represent all people’s experiences. But what happens when the patterns disrupt our assumptions?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p04">For example, did you know that teachers are far more likely to encourage boys to think critically in school by asking them to expand on answers they give in class and by commenting on boys’ remarks and observations? When girls speak up in class, teachers are more likely to simply nod and move on. The <em class="emphasis">pattern</em> of teachers engaging in more complex interactions with boys means that boys and girls do not receive the same educational experience in school (Sadker &amp; Sadker, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_007">Sadker, M., &amp; Sadker, D. (1994). <em class="emphasis">Failing at fairness: How America’s schools cheat girls</em>. New York, NY: Maxwell Macmillan International.</span> You and your classmates, both men and women, may find this news upsetting.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p05">Objectors to these findings tend to cite evidence from their own personal experience, refuting that the pattern actually exists. The problem with this response, however, is that objecting to a social pattern on the grounds that it doesn’t match one’s individual experience misses the point about patterns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p06">Another matter that social scientists must consider is where they stand on the value of basic as opposed to applied research. In essence, this has to do with questions of for whom and for what purpose research is conducted. We can think of basic and applied research as resting on either end of a continuum. In sociology, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">basic research</a><span class="glossdef">Sociology for sociology’s sake; research that is motivated solely by researcher interest.</span></span> is sociology for sociology’s sake. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes researchers are motivated to conduct research simply because they happen to be interested in a topic. In this case, the goal of the research may be to learn more about a topic. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Applied research</a><span class="glossdef">Research that is conducted for some purpose beyond or in addition to researcher interest.</span></span> lies at the other end of the continuum. In sociology, applied research refers to sociology that is conducted for some purpose beyond or in addition to a researcher’s interest in a topic. Applied research is often client focused, meaning that the researcher is investigating a question posed by someone other than her or himself. What do <em class="emphasis">you</em> think the purpose of sociology should be? Should sociologists conduct research for its own sake, if it has some identifiable application, or perhaps for something in between?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p07">A trend some might say lies near the middle of the basic/applied continuum is public sociology. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Public sociology</a><span class="glossdef">The application of sociological theories and research to matters of public interest.</span></span> refers the application of sociological theories and research to matters of public interest. You might recall from your introductory sociology class that sociology’s origins in fact lie in matters of public interest: the desire to understand the consequences of industrialization and to find solutions for the ills of society (Henslin, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_008">Henslin, J. M. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Essentials of sociology: A down-to-earth approach</em> (6th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon.</span> However, all sociologists have never agreed on what the purpose of sociology is or should be. The pendulum of interest in basic research to a more publicly focused sociology has swung back and forth over the many years that sociology has existed (Calhoun, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_009">Calhoun, C. (Ed.). (2007). <em class="emphasis">Sociology in America: A history</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> Since 2004, when then-president of the American Sociological Association (ASA) Michael Burawoy (2005)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_010">Burawoy, M. (2005). 2004 presidential address: For public sociology. <em class="emphasis">American Sociological Review, 70</em>, 4–28.</span> delivered a talk to the ASA membership imploring sociologists to become more publicly engaged in their work, a new wave of debate about the purpose of sociology began to build. Today, some argue that public sociology puts too little emphasis on sociology as a science,<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_011">See, for example, Mathieu Deflem’s arguments against public sociology on his website: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.savesociology.org">http://www.savesociology.org</a>.</span> while others assert that sociology is, has been, and must remain public (Jeffries, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_012">Jeffries, V. (Ed.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Handbook of sociology</em>. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> While there are no easy answers here, it is worth taking some time to think about your position on this issue. Your perspective on the purpose of sociology will shape the questions you ask in your research and may even shape how you attempt to answer those questions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p08">One final consideration that social scientists must be aware of is the difference between qualitative and quantitative methods. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Qualitative methods</a><span class="glossdef">Ways of collecting data that yield results such as words or pictures.</span></span> are ways of collecting data that yield results such as words or pictures. Some of the most common qualitative methods in sociology include field research, intensive interviews, and focus groups. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quantitative methods</a><span class="glossdef">Ways of collecting data that can be represented by and condensed into numbers.</span></span>, on the other hand, result in data that can be represented by and condensed into numbers. Survey research is probably the most common quantitative method in sociology, but methods such as content analysis and interviewing can also be conducted in a way that yields quantitative data. While qualitative methods aim to gain an in-depth understanding of a relatively small number of cases, quantitative methods offer less depth but more breadth because they typically focus on a much larger number of cases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p09">Sometimes these two methods are presented or discussed in a way that suggests they are somehow in opposition to one another. The qualitative/quantitative debate is fueled by researchers who may prefer one approach over another, either because their own research questions are better suited to one particular approach or because they happened to have been trained in one specific method. In this text, we’ll operate from the perspective that qualitative and quantitative methods are complementary rather than competing. While these two methodological approaches certainly differ, the main point is that they simply have different goals, strengths, and weaknesses. We’ll explore the goals, strengths, and weaknesses of both approaches in more depth in later chapters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p10">In sum, social scientists should be aware of the following considerations:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Social science is concerned with patterns in society.</li>

            <li>Sociological research projects typically rest somewhere on a continuum from basic research to public sociology to applied research.</li>
            <li>Qualitative methods are those that yield data such as words or pictures; quantitative methods are those that yield data such as numbers.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s03_p01">At this point, you may be wondering about the relevance of research methods to your life. Whether or not you choose to become a sociologist, you should care about research methods for two basic reasons: (a) research methods are regularly applied to solve social problems and issues that shape how our society is organized, thus you have to live with the results of research methods every day of your life, and (b) understanding research methods might actually help you land a job.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Another <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em> cartoon depicts two men chatting with each other at a bar. One is saying to the other, “Are you just pissing and moaning, or can you verify what you’re saying with data?” (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/1999/are-you-just-pissing-and-moaning-or-can-you-verify-what-youre-saying-with-data/invt/118737/">http://www.cartoonbank.com/1999/are-you-just-pissing-and-moaning-or-can-you-verify-what-youre-saying-with-data/invt/118737/</a>). Which would you rather be, just a complainer or someone who can actually verify what you’re saying? Understanding research methods and how they work can help position you to actually do more than just complain. Further, whether you know it or not, research probably has some impact on your life each and every day. Many of our laws, social policies, and court proceedings are grounded in some degree of empirical research (Jenkins &amp; Kroll-Smith, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_013">Jenkins, P. J., &amp; Kroll-Smith, S. (Eds.). (1996). <em class="emphasis">Witnessing for sociology: Sociologists in court</em>. Westport, CT: Praeger.</span> That’s not to say that all laws and social policies are good or make sense. However, you can’t have an informed opinion about any of them without understanding where they come from, how they were formed, and what understandings our policymakers relied on in order to craft them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p02">A recent lawsuit against Walmart provides an example of sociological research in action. A sociologist named Professor William Bielby was enlisted by plaintiffs in the suit to conduct an analysis of Walmart’s personnel policies in order to support their claim that Walmart engages in gender discriminatory practices. Bielby’s analysis shows that Walmart’s compensation and promotion decisions may indeed have been vulnerable to gender bias. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court decided against allowing the case to proceed as a class-action lawsuit.<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn01_014"><em class="emphasis">Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Ever notice the magazine headlines that peer out at you while you are waiting in line to pay for your groceries? They are geared toward piquing your interest and making you believe that you will learn a great deal if you follow the advice in a particular article. However, since you would have no way of knowing whether the magazine’s editors had gathered their data from a representative sample of people like you and your friends, you would have no reason to believe that the advice would be worthwhile. By having some understanding of research methods, you could avoid wasting your money by buying the magazine and wasting your time by following inappropriate advice.</p>

Understanding research methods will help you read past any hype and ask good questions about what you see and hear. In other words, research methods can help you become a more responsible consumer of public and popular information. And who wouldn’t want to be more responsible?</p>

While there, I worked as a data-collection coordinator, helping in the evaluation of local domestic violence shelters and transitional housing sites by administering satisfaction surveys to residents. I also helped collect data for a study on community member’s thoughts and feelings about where they lived by conducting telephone interviews with a random sample of people who lived in the area. (This last project made me much more sensitive than I’d previously been to survey researchers who do cold-calling.) Without a background in research methods, I would not have been hired for this position.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02">Upon graduation from college, you, too, may enjoy the benefits of employment thanks to having learned social science research methods in college. Some current jobs of sociologists I know include jobs doing research in pharmaceutical companies to understand the social consequences of medications, conducting research for lobbying organizations, working in human resources, and so on. Other recent undergraduate sociology majors went on to conduct market research in the advertising industry, work for the United States Census and other federal government positions, and even help with the collection of data for large social science studies such as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">General Social Survey</a><span class="glossdef">The General Social Survey (GSS) is one of the largest sources of social scientific data in the United States.

In <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch08#blackstone_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Survey Research: A Quantitative Technique"</a> through <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch12#blackstone_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Other Methods of Data Collection and Analysis"</a>, we’ll grant equal time to qualitative and quantitative research methods and examine the methods most commonly used in sociological research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p03">The final set of chapters focuses on the social context of research. In this section, we’ll revisit some of the points introduced here in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch01#blackstone_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction"</a> by reminding ourselves of why any of what you’ve read matters. We’ll take a look at some of the principles and practices involved in sharing one’s work; consider some tips for being responsible consumers of social scientific research; and review some of the ways that knowledge in research methods comes in handy for those interested in jobs, social change, or simply being engaged members of society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p04">What will be the payoff to you for reading all this material? Hopefully you will feel you’ve gained a real understanding of research methods, how and why they are relevant to <em class="emphasis">you</em>, and the importance of methods to sociological understanding about our world.</p>
