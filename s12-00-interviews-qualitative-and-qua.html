        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Interview Research?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s00_p01">Today’s young men are delaying their entry into adulthood. That’s a nice way of saying they are “totally confused”; “cannot commit to their relationships, work, or lives”; and are “obsessed with never wanting to grow up.”<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_001">These quotes come from a summary of reviews on the website dedicated to Kimmel’s book, <em class="emphasis">Guyland</em>: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.guyland.net">http://www.guyland.net</a>.</span> But don’t take my word for it. Take sociologist Michael Kimmel’s word. He interviewed 400 young men, ages 16 to 26, over the course of 4 years across the United States to learn how they made the transition from adolescence into adulthood. Since the results of Kimmel’s research were published in 2008,<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_002">Kimmel, M. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Guyland: The perilous world where boys become men</em>. New York, NY: Harper Collins.</span> his book has made quite a splash. Featured in news reports, on blogs, and in many book reviews, some claim Kimmel’s research “could save the humanity of many young men,”<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_003">This quote from Gloria Steinem is provided on the website dedicated to Kimmel’s book, <em class="emphasis">Guyland</em>: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.guyland.net">http://www.guyland.net</a>.</span> while others suggest that its conclusions can only be applied to “fraternity guys and jocks.”<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_004">This quote comes from “Thomas,” who wrote a review of Kimmel’s book on the following site: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/review-guyland">http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/03/12/review-guyland</a>.</span> Whatever your take on Kimmel’s research, one thing remains true: We surely would not know nearly as much as we now do about the lives of many young American men were it not for interview research.</p>
