    <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_p01">Qualitative interviews are sometimes called intensive or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">in-depth interviews</a><span class="glossdef">A semistructured meeting between a researcher and respondent in which the researcher asks a series of open-ended questions; questions may be posed to respondents in slightly different ways or orders.</span></span>. These interviews are semistructured; the researcher has a particular topic about which he or she would like to hear from the respondent, but questions are open ended and may not be asked in exactly the same way or in exactly the same order to each and every respondent. In in-depth interviews, the primary aim is to hear from respondents about what <em class="emphasis">they</em> think is important about the topic at hand and to hear it in their own words. In this section, we’ll take a look at how to conduct interviews that are specifically qualitative in nature, analyze qualitative interview data, and use some of the strengths and weaknesses of this method. In <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s04#blackstone_1.0-ch09_s04">Section 9.4 "Issues to Consider for All Interview Types"</a>, we return to several considerations that are relevant to both qualitative and quantitative interviewing.</p>
    <div class="section" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conducting Qualitative Interviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p01">Qualitative interviews might feel more like a conversation than an interview to respondents, but the researcher is in fact usually guiding the conversation with the goal in mind of gathering information from a respondent. A key difference between qualitative and quantitative interviewing is that qualitative interviews contain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open-ended questions</a><span class="glossdef">Questions for which a researcher does not provide answer options; questions that require respondents to answer in their own words.</span></span>. The meaning of this term is of course implied by its name, but just so that we’re sure to be on the same page, I’ll tell you that open-ended questions are questions that a researcher poses but does <em class="emphasis">not</em> provide answer options for. Open-ended questions are more demanding of participants than closed-ended questions, for they require participants to come up with their own words, phrases, or sentences to respond.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p02">In a qualitative interview, the researcher usually develops a guide in advance that he or she then refers to during the interview (or memorizes in advance of the interview). An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interview guide</a><span class="glossdef">A list of topics or questions that an interviewer hopes to cover during the course of an interview.</span></span> is a list of topics or questions that the interviewer hopes to cover during the course of an interview. It is called a guide because it is simply that—it is used to guide the interviewer, but it is not set in stone. Think of an interview guide like your agenda for the day or your to-do list—both probably contain all the items you hope to check off or accomplish, though it probably won’t be the end of the world if you don’t accomplish everything on the list or if you don’t accomplish it in the exact order that you have it written down. Perhaps new events will come up that cause you to rearrange your schedule just a bit, or perhaps you simply won’t get to everything on the list.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p03">Interview guides should outline issues that a researcher feels are likely to be important, but because participants are asked to provide answers in their own words, and to raise points that they believe are important, each interview is likely to flow a little differently. While the opening question in an in-depth interview may be the same across all interviews, from that point on what the participant says will shape how the interview proceeds. This, I believe, is what makes in-depth interviewing so exciting. It is also what makes in-depth interviewing rather challenging to conduct. It takes a skilled interviewer to be able to ask questions; actually <em class="emphasis">listen</em> to respondents; and pick up on cues about when to follow up, when to move on, and when to simply let the participant speak without guidance or interruption.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p04">I’ve said that interview guides can list topics or questions. The specific format of an interview guide might depend on your style, experience, and comfort level as an interviewer or with your topic. I have conducted interviews using different kinds of guides. In my interviews of young people about their experiences with workplace sexual harassment, the guide I used was topic based. There were few specific questions contained in the guide. Instead, I had an outline of topics that I hoped to cover, listed in an order that I thought it might make sense to cover them, noted on a sheet of paper. That guide can be seen in <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_f02">Figure 9.4 "Interview Guide Displaying Topics Rather Than Questions"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p05">In my interviews with child-free adults, the interview guide contained questions rather than brief topics. One reason I took this approach is that this was a topic with which I had less familiarity than workplace sexual harassment. I’d been studying harassment for some time before I began those interviews, and I had already analyzed much quantitative survey data on the topic. When I began the child-free interviews, I was embarking on a research topic that was entirely new for me. I was also studying a topic about which I have strong personal feelings, and I wanted to be sure that I phrased my questions in a way that didn’t appear biased to respondents. To help ward off that possibility, I wrote down specific question wording in my interview guide. As I conducted more and more interviews, and read more and more of the literature on child-free adults, I became more confident about my ability to ask open-ended, nonbiased questions about the topic without the guide, but having some specific questions written down at the start of the data collection process certainly helped. The interview guide I used for the child-free project is displayed in <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_f03">Figure 9.5 "Interview Guide Displaying Questions Rather Than Topics"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p06">As you might have guessed, interview guides do not appear out of thin air. They are the result of thoughtful and careful work on the part of a researcher. As you can see in both of the preceding guides, the topics and questions have been organized thematically and in the order in which they are likely to proceed (though keep in mind that the flow of a qualitative interview is in part determined by what a respondent has to say). Sometimes qualitative interviewers may create two versions of the interview guide: one version contains a very brief outline of the interview, perhaps with just topic headings, and another version contains detailed questions underneath each topic heading. In this case, the researcher might use the very detailed guide to prepare and practice in advance of actually conducting interviews and then just bring the brief outline to the interview. Bringing an outline, as opposed to a very long list of detailed questions, to an interview encourages the researcher to actually listen to what a participant is telling her. An overly detailed interview guide will be difficult to navigate through during an interview and could give respondents the misimpression that the interviewer is more interested in her questions than in the participant’s answers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p07">When beginning to construct an interview guide, brainstorming is usually the first step. There are no rules at the brainstorming stage—simply list all the topics and questions that come to mind when you think about your research question. Once you’ve got a pretty good list, you can begin to pare it down by cutting questions and topics that seem redundant and group like questions and topics together. If you haven’t done so yet, you may also want to come up with question and topic headings for your grouped categories. You should also consult the scholarly literature to find out what kinds of questions other interviewers have asked in studies of similar topics. As with quantitative survey research, it is best not to place very sensitive or potentially controversial questions at the very beginning of your qualitative interview guide. You need to give participants the opportunity to warm up to the interview and to feel comfortable talking with you. Finally, get some feedback on your interview guide. Ask your friends, family members, and your professors for some guidance and suggestions once you’ve come up with what you think is a pretty strong guide. Chances are they’ll catch a few things you hadn’t noticed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p08">In terms of the specific questions you include on your guide, there are a few guidelines worth noting. First, try to avoid questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no, or if you do choose to include such questions, be sure to include follow-up questions. Remember, one of the benefits of qualitative interviews is that you <em class="emphasis">can</em> ask participants for more information—be sure to do so. While it is a good idea to ask follow-up questions, try to avoid asking “why” as your follow-up question, as this particular question can come off as confrontational, even if that is not how you intend it. Often people won’t know how to respond to “why,” perhaps because they don’t even know why themselves. Instead of “why,” I recommend that you say something like, “Could you tell me a little more about that?” This allows participants to explain themselves further without feeling that they’re being doubted or questioned in a hostile way.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p09">Also, try to avoid phrasing your questions in a leading way. For example, rather than asking, “Don’t you think that most people who don’t want kids are selfish?” you could ask, “What comes to mind for you when you hear that someone doesn’t want kids?” Or rather than asking, “What do you think about juvenile delinquents who drink and drive?” you could ask, “How do you feel about underage drinking?” or “What do you think about drinking and driving?” Finally, as noted earlier in this section, remember to keep most, if not all, of your questions open ended. The key to a successful qualitative interview is giving participants the opportunity to share information in their own words and in their own way.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p10">Even after the interview guide is constructed, the interviewer is not yet ready to begin conducting interviews. The researcher next has to decide how to collect and maintain the information that is provided by participants. It is probably most common for qualitative interviewers to take audio recordings of the interviews they conduct.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p11">Recording interviews allows the researcher to focus on her or his interaction with the interview participant rather than being distracted by trying to take notes. Of course, not all participants will feel comfortable being recorded and sometimes even the interviewer may feel that the subject is so sensitive that recording would be inappropriate. If this is the case, it is up to the researcher to balance excellent note-taking with exceptional question asking and even better listening. I don’t think I can understate the difficulty of managing all these feats simultaneously. Whether you will be recording your interviews or not (and <em class="emphasis">especially</em> if not), practicing the interview in advance is crucial. Ideally, you’ll find a friend or two willing to participate in a couple of trial runs with you. Even better, you’ll find a friend or two who are similar in at least some ways to your sample. They can give you the best feedback on your questions and your interview demeanor.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p12">All interviewers should be aware of, give some thought to, and plan for several additional factors, such as where to conduct an interview and how to make participants as comfortable as possible during an interview. Because these factors should be considered by both qualitative and quantitative interviewers, we will return to them in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s04#blackstone_1.0-ch09_s04">Section 9.4 "Issues to Consider for All Interview Types"</a> after we’ve had a chance to look at some of the unique features of each approach to interviewing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s01_p13">Although our focus here has been on interviews for which there is one interviewer and one respondent, this is certainly not the only way to conduct a qualitative interview. Sometimes there may be multiple respondents present, and occasionally more than one interviewer may be present as well. When multiple respondents participate in an interview at the same time, this is referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus group</a><span class="glossdef">Multiple respondents participate in an interview at the same time.</span></span>. Focus groups can be an excellent way to gather information because topics or questions that hadn’t occurred to the researcher may be brought up by other participants in the group. Having respondents talk with and ask questions of one another can be an excellent way of learning about a topic; not only might respondents ask questions that hadn’t occurred to the researcher, but the researcher can also learn from respondents’ body language around and interactions with one another. Of course, there are some unique ethical concerns associated with collecting data in a group setting. We’ll take a closer look at how focus groups work and describe some potential ethical concerns associated with them in <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch12#blackstone_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Other Methods of Data Collection and Analysis"</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Analysis of Qualitative Interview Data</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Analysis of qualitative interview data typically begins with a set of transcripts of the interviews conducted. Obtaining said transcripts requires having either taken exceptionally good notes during an interview or, preferably, recorded the interview and then transcribed it. Transcribing interviews is usually the first step toward analyzing qualitative interview data. To <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transcribe</a><span class="glossdef">Creating a complete, written copy of a recorded interview by playing the recording back and typing in each word that is spoken on the recording, noting who spoke which words.</span></span> an interview means that you create, or someone whom you’ve hired creates, a complete, written copy of the recorded interview by playing the recording back and typing in each word that is spoken on the recording, noting who spoke which words. In general, it is best to aim for a verbatim transcription, one that reports word for word exactly what was said in the recorded interview. If possible, it is also best to include nonverbals in an interview’s written transcription. Gestures made by respondents should be noted, as should the tone of voice and notes about when, where, and how spoken words may have been emphasized by respondents.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p02">If you have the time (or if you lack the resources to hire others), I think it is best to transcribe your interviews yourself. I never cease to be amazed by the things I recall from an interview when I transcribe it myself. If the researcher who conducted the interview transcribes it himself or herself, that person will also be able to make a note of nonverbal behaviors and interactions that may be relevant to analysis but that could not be picked up by audio recording. I’ve seen interviewees roll their eyes, wipe tears from their face, and even make obscene gestures that spoke volumes about their feelings but that could not have been recorded had I not remembered to include these details in their transcribed interviews.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p03">The goal of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analysis</a><span class="glossdef">The process of arriving at some inferences, lessons, or conclusions by condensing large amounts of data into relatively smaller bits of understandable information.</span></span> is to reach some inferences, lessons, or conclusions by condensing large amounts of data into relatively smaller, more manageable bits of understandable information. Analysis of qualitative interview data often works inductively (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Charmaz, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_008">For an additional reminder about what an inductive approach to analysis means, see <a class="xref" href="blackstone_1.0-ch02#blackstone_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Linking Methods With Theory"</a>. If you would like to learn more about inductive qualitative data analysis, I recommend two titles: Glaser, B. G., &amp; Strauss, A. L. (1967). <em class="emphasis">The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research</em>. Chicago, IL: Aldine; Charmaz, K. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Constructing grounded theory: A practical guide through qualitative analysis</em>. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> To move from the specific observations an interviewer collects to identifying patterns across those observations, qualitative interviewers will often begin by reading through transcripts of their interviews and trying to identify codes. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">code</a><span class="glossdef">A shorthand representation of some more complex set of issues or ideas.</span></span> is a shorthand representation of some more complex set of issues or ideas. In this usage, the word <em class="emphasis">code</em> is a noun. But it can also be a verb. The process of identifying codes in one’s qualitative data is often referred to as <em class="emphasis">coding</em>. Coding involves identifying themes across interview data by reading and rereading (and rereading again) interview transcripts until the researcher has a clear idea about what sorts of themes come up across the interviews.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p04">Qualitative researcher and textbook author Kristin Esterberg (2002)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_009">Esterberg, K. G. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Qualitative methods in social research</em>. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> describes coding as a multistage process. Esterberg suggests that there are two types of coding: open coding and focused coding. To analyze qualitative interview data, one can begin by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open coding</a><span class="glossdef">The first stage of developing codes in qualitative data; involves reading data with an open mind and jotting down themes or categories that various bits of data seem to suggest.</span></span> transcripts. This means that you read through each transcript, line by line, and make a note of whatever categories or themes seem to jump out to you. At this stage, it is important that you not let your original research question or expectations about what you <em class="emphasis">think</em> you might find cloud your ability to see categories or themes. It’s called <em class="emphasis">open</em> coding for a reason—keep an open mind. Open coding will probably require multiple go-rounds. As you read through your transcripts, it is likely that you’ll begin to see some commonalities across the categories or themes that you’ve jotted down. Once you do, you might begin focused coding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Focused coding</a><span class="glossdef">A later stage of developing codes in qualitative data; occurs after open coding and involves collapsing or narrowing themes and categories identified in open coding, succinctly naming them, describing them, and identifying passages of data that represent them.</span></span> involves collapsing or narrowing themes and categories identified in open coding by reading through the notes you made while conducting open coding. Identify themes or categories that seem to be related, perhaps merging some. Then give each collapsed/merged theme or category a name (or code), and identify passages of data that fit each named category or theme. To identify passages of data that represent your emerging codes, you’ll need to read through your transcripts yet again (and probably again). You might also write up brief definitions or descriptions of each code. Defining codes is a way of making meaning of your data and of developing a way to talk about your findings and what your data mean. Guess what? You are officially analyzing data!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p06">As tedious and laborious as it might seem to read through hundreds of pages of transcripts multiple times, sometimes getting started with the coding process is actually the hardest part. If you find yourself struggling to identify themes at the open coding stage, ask yourself some questions about your data. The answers should give you a clue about what sorts of themes or categories you are reading. In their text on analyzing qualitative data, Lofland and Lofland (1995)<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_010">Lofland, J., &amp; Lofland, L. H. (1995). <em class="emphasis">Analyzing social settings: A guide to qualitative observation and analysis</em> (3rd ed.) Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> identify a set of questions that I find very useful when coding qualitative data. They suggest asking the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Of what topic, unit, or aspect is this an instance?</li>
            <li>What question about a topic does this item of data suggest?</li>
            <li>What sort of answer to a question about a topic does this item of data suggest (i.e., what proposition is suggested)?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p07">Asking yourself these questions about the passages of data that you’re reading can help you begin to identify and name potential themes and categories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p08">Still feeling uncertain about how this process works? Sometimes it helps to see how interview passages translate into codes. In <a class="xref" href="#blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_t01">Table 9.1 "Interview Coding Example"</a>, I present two codes that emerged from the inductive analysis of transcripts from my interviews with child-free adults. I also include a brief description of each code and a few (of many) interview excerpts from which each code was developed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p09">As you might imagine, wading through all these data is quite a process. Just as quantitative researchers rely on the assistance of special computer programs designed to help with sorting through and analyzing their data, so, too, do qualitative researchers. Where quantitative researchers have SPSS and MicroCase (and many others), qualitative researchers have programs such as NVivo (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.qsrinternational.com">http://www.qsrinternational.com</a>) and Atlasti (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.atlasti.com">http://www.atlasti.com</a>). These are programs specifically designed to assist qualitative researchers with organizing, managing, sorting, and analyzing large amounts of qualitative data. The programs work by allowing researchers to import interview transcripts contained in an electronic file and then label or code passages, cut and paste passages, search for various words or phrases, and organize complex interrelationships among passages and codes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p10">In sum, the following excerpt, from a paper analyzing the workplace sexual harassment interview data I have mentioned previously, summarizes how the process of analyzing qualitative interview data often works:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s02_p11">All interviews were tape recorded and then transcribed and imported into the computer program NVivo. NVivo is designed to assist researchers with organizing, managing, interpreting, and analyzing non-numerical, qualitative data. Once the transcripts, ranging from 20 to 60 pages each, were imported into NVivo, we first coded the data according to the themes outlined in our interview guide. We then closely reviewed each transcript again, looking for common themes across interviews and coding like categories of data together. These passages, referred to as codes or “meaning units” (Weiss, 2004),<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_011">Weiss, R. S. (2004). In their own words: Making the most of qualitative interviews. <em class="emphasis">Contexts, 3</em>, 44–51.</span> were then labeled and given a name intended to succinctly portray the themes present in the code. For this paper, we coded every quote that had something to do with the labeling of harassment. After reviewing passages within the “labeling” code, we placed quotes that seemed related together, creating several sub-codes. These sub-codes were named and are represented by the three subtitles within the findings section of this paper.<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_012">Our three subcodes were the following: (a) “It’s different because you’re in high school”: Sociability and socialization at work; (b) Looking back: “It was sexual harassment; I just didn’t know it at the time”; and (c) Looking ahead: New images of self as worker and of workplace interactions.</span> Once our sub-codes were labeled, we re-examined the interview transcripts, coding additional quotes that fit the theme of each sub-code.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Strengths and Weaknesses of Qualitative Interviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p01">As the preceding sections have suggested, qualitative interviews are an excellent way to gather detailed information. Whatever topic is of interest to the researcher employing this method can be explored in much more depth than with almost any other method. Not only are participants given the opportunity to elaborate in a way that is not possible with other methods such as survey research, but they also are able share information with researchers in their own words and from their own perspectives rather than being asked to fit those perspectives into the perhaps limited response options provided by the researcher. And because qualitative interviews are designed to elicit detailed information, they are especially useful when a researcher’s aim is to study social processes, or the “how” of various phenomena. Yet another, and sometimes overlooked, benefit of qualitative interviews that occurs in person is that researchers can make observations beyond those that a respondent is orally reporting. A respondent’s body language, and even her or his choice of time and location for the interview, might provide a researcher with useful data.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="blackstone_1.0-ch09_s02_s03_p02">Of course, all these benefits do not come without some drawbacks. As with quantitative survey research, qualitative interviews rely on respondents’ ability to accurately and honestly recall whatever details about their lives, circumstances, thoughts, opinions, or behaviors are being asked about. As Esterberg (2002) puts it, “If you want to know about what people actually do, rather than what they say they do, you should probably use observation [instead of interviews].”<span class="footnote" id="blackstone_1.0-fn09_014">Esterberg, K. G. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Qualitative methods in social research</em>. Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill.</span> Further, as you may have already guessed, qualitative interviewing is time intensive and can be quite expensive. Creating an interview guide, identifying a sample, and conducting interviews are just the beginning. Transcribing interviews is labor intensive—and that’s before coding even begins. It is also not uncommon to offer respondents some monetary incentive or thank-you for participating. Keep in mind that you are asking for more of participants’ time than if you’d simply mailed them a questionnaire containing closed-ended questions. Conducting qualitative interviews is not only labor intensive but also emotionally taxing. When I interviewed young workers about their sexual harassment experiences, I heard stories that were shocking, infuriating, and sad. Seeing and hearing the impact that harassment had had on respondents was difficult. Researchers embarking on a qualitative interview project should keep in mind their own abilities to hear stories that may be difficult to hear.</p>
